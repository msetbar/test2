# Prompt Impact on Azure Cognitive Search

## Purpose

Experiment with the successful prompt variants 1 and 5 (from the [first prompt engineering experiment](../prompt-engineering/user-story-110025-basic-prompt-engineering.md)) on the full ~3700 set using Azure Cognitive Search as the backing vector DB.

- **Prompt 1**: "Use the context delimited by triple backticks to answer the question at the end. Provide step by step instructions if available. First find the relevant information and then answer the question based on the relevant information. \n```{context}```\n\nQuestion: {question}\n Helpful Answer:"

- **Prompt 5**: "You are a helpful AI assistant whose primary goal is to help AT&T customer support agents using a provided context. Use the context delimited by triple backticks to answer the question at the end. Provide step by step instructions if available. First find the relevant information and then answer the question based on the relevant information. DO NOT ANSWER any question outside of the provided context. \n```{context}```\n\nQuestion: {question}?\n Helpful Answer:"

Evaluate the effect of the prompt and ensure we are not seeing any degradations from the initial analysis which was done on a small set of 375 articles on Milvus.

### Observation 3: Inconsistent Answer with "No specific information provided in the context" between prompt 1 and prompt5

- **Number of cases for Prompt 1**: 3
- **Number of cases for Prompt 5**: 2

The following table contains few a of the questions where the answer generated does not match to the information presented in the
`reranker_chunks` field. There are a few variations depending of the prompt used.

|Question ID|Question|Promp 1 Gen Answer|Promp 5 Gen Answer|
|---|---|---|---|
|60071 |Is Turkey covered with international day pass? | Yes, Turkey is covered with the International Day Pass, as it is one of the 210+ countries included in the plan. | I cannot provide a specific answer about Turkey being covered with the International Day Pass, as the provided context does not include a list of covered countries. To check if Turkey is covered, you would need to visit att.com/globalcountries for the list of AT&T International Day Pass destinations.
|60028| return equipment no account verification | If you need to return equipment without account verification, follow these steps: 1. Check if the equipment is being used on another line. 2. Verify if AT&T sent the RMA label to the customer within the Buyer's Remorse (BRE) period. 3. Check if the equipment shows as Returned in the warehouse. 4. Confirm that AT&T did not already issue the credit. 5. Note the account with your findings. If you are unable to verify the equipment as being returned in the warehouse, you can use additional research methods such as: 1. Review Clarify and biller notes for a tracking number. 2. Look up the tracking number based on the customer shipping method (FedEx, UPS, or Smart Label Tracking). 3. If there is no tracking number documented in the customer account, contact the customer and see if they can provide the tracking number. 4. Check billed calls and see if the phone is currently in use on the account. Remember to subtract the restocking fee for devices (excluding tablets and iPads) from the equipment price when determining the adjustment amount. | I'm sorry, but I cannot provide an answer to your question as it is not related to the provided context. Please provide a question that is relevant to the context given. |

In the previous examples, Prompt 1 response to question 60071 is invalid as we don't see Turkey in the chunks returns but LLM is generating an answer to the yes/no question. See chunk details below. In contrast, 60028 is invalid for Prompt 5 because the information is presented in the reranker_chunks as it does with Prompt 1.

### Miscellaneous

There were some bugs that were noticed in trials feedback:

1. [Capital Letters in Prompt giving different result](https://dev.azure.com/ACC-Azure-04/CDO-Data-Illuminate/_workitems/edit/109990)
1. [Same Prompt generates different result](https://dev.azure.com/ACC-Azure-04/CDO-Data-Illuminate/_workitems/edit/109992)
1. [Yes/No Question - LLM generative answer does not match Top 3 chunks returned](https://dev.azure.com/ACC-Azure-04/CDO-Data-Illuminate/_workitems/edit/109995)
1. [Not grounded on the Knowledge Articles](https://dev.azure.com/ACC-Azure-04/CDO-Data-Illuminate/_workitems/edit/109997)

All these issues are now addressed. For instance, now the LLM does not asnwer to the question `What is the meaning of life?`
as it is not grounded by the articles.

See the following table for the generated answers when we ask the same questions:

| Query | Response using prompt 1 | Response using prompt 5|

|Payment Arrangement | A payment arrangement is a way to delay a payment if a customer cannot pay the bill on the due date. It is a promise to pay (by mail, in person, online, or by phone) or a scheduled payment with a bank account or card that will process after the bill due date. Payment arrangements must be set for at least the entire past due balance. All adjustments must be made to an account prior to creating a payment arrangement. AutoPay will need to be suspended for those customers wishing to make a payment arrangement, and it will resume the next bill period. | A payment arrangement is a promise to pay (by mail, in person, online, by phone) or a scheduled payment with a bank account or card that will process after the bill due date. It allows customers to delay a payment if they cannot pay the bill on the due date, keeping their service active and letting AT&T know when and how the balance will be paid. However, it does not prevent a late payment fee. Payment arrangements must be set for at least the entire past due balance.

## Conclusion

- Valid responses (non "no context") are returned for 98% of the Grouth Truth Set and
the answers are grounded.
- In the cases of "no context" responses (2%), the response is valid as the returned
chunks from the reranker do not have the context as well.
- There isn't much variation in the quality between Prompt 1 and Prompt 5.
- Based on the overall responses, Prompt 5 tends to be more assertive and less likely to hallucinate. We suggest to use [Prompt 5](./user-story-110025-basic-prompt-engineering.md#5---question-mark-and-casing-used-to-explicitly-ground-generated-answers-in-context) in our upcoming experiments.

We observed less than 1% of the responses between the two prompts were vastly different with an equal probability of either being right. 
Even though we manually compared the results of the no context answers, there are further plans to take an LLM based approached to compare two LLM responses
and evaluate how vastly different they are.
